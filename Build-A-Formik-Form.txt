# Formik Login Form

## Description

This project demonstrates a login form with validation using Formik, a library that simplifies form handling in React. The form collects a user's email and password and provides real-time validation feedback for empty fields and invalid email format. When the form is successfully submitted with valid inputs, it shows an alert with "Login Successful."
